    <h1>Lists</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Whether it be IMDB's top 250 movies or the FBI's most wanted, lists are everywhere on the web and you are going to need one eventually in your webpages.
        <br><br>
        Luckily, with HTML there are a couple of different types of lists at your disposal.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
    <p>If you want to have a list of items where the order doesn't matter, like a shopping list or items that can be bought in any order, then you can use an unordered list.
        <br><br>
        Unordered lists are created using the |< ul  >| element, and each item within the list is created using the list item element |< li >|.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>    
    <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
    <p>If you instead want to create a list of items where the order <em>does</em> matter, like step-by-step instructions for a recipe, or your top 10 favorite TV shows, then you can use an ordered list.
        <br><br>
        Ordered lists are created using the |< ol >| element. Each individual item in them is again created using the list item element |< li >|. 
        <br><br>
        However, each list item in an ordered list begins with a number instead:
    </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ol>

    </p>
